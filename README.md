# SimpleNodeJSNetworkGame
A simple local network game using Node.js
This is from a tutorial at:
https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-basic-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-socket-io-part-1/

The files uploaded here are the ones you will create following the tutorial. Well at least written by me following the tutorial.
Node.js, Express, and NPM need to be on your computer to get this to work. Follow the tutorial on how to do that.
